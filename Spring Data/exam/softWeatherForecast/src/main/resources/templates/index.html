                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The software of Weather Forecasts has crashed and the owner has turned to SoftUni for help.
                        Now a small team led by you must take on this task and make the SoftWeather Forecast.
                        <br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offer a better experience to its customers, the SoftWeather team urgently needs a good enough
                        application that collects all the information about all weather forecasts and can, with one click,
                        dig through the sorted best locations for the weekend.
